# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator written in JavaScript. It generates random passwords based on a set of characters that you can customize. The default set of characters includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and a selection of special characters.

## Getting started

To use this password generator, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Click the "Generate passwords" button to generate a set of random passwords. The passwords will appear in the boxes below the button.

## Customizing the password generator

If you want to customize the set of characters that the password generator uses, you can edit the `AllCharacters` array in the `index.js` file. Simply add or remove characters from the array as desired. You can also change the length of the generated passwords by adjusting the `myPassLenght` variable.
